Just a small set of Python3 scripts for pentesting purposes

hostscan.py     ---> active network scanning with the use of nmap module

SQL_injector.py ---> Intercepts login form packets and runs sqlmap (just to automate SQL Injection process)

SQL_injector_man.py ---> Manual version of above. User needs to interact by accessing webpage and manually filling form

Only for educational purposes!
